title: Don't Change Your Tweets

I remember when I had people we all consider experts start following me. It was pretty cool. Though it also brought on a lot of anxiety. It was as though now that important people were paying attention. I had to rise to their level and expertise. All a sudden I felt that none of my tweets might be adequate. I sat with this for a while and realized it to be wrong thinking. Look at it this way:

<strong>They followed me because of tweets I sent when they weren't following me. And so if I now alter my tweets because they follow me. I won't be providing what they followed me for!</strong>

Sounds logical, right? Though easier said than done. Just because we understand something to be logical. It doesn't mean our worrying mind goes right along with it.

I sat some more and landed on this:

There is nothing more special in this world than being yourself. We do a disservice to humanity by not sharing our uniqueness. Innovation almost requires thinking differently as I'm sure Steve Jobs and many others would argue.

So, don't hold back. Before sending tweets, I've sat there thinking it was stupid, unimportant. My drafts folder scrolls forever. But when I do hit send. Often I'm surprised at the interest. Here I was soaking in self-sabotage. Only to have the universe prove me wrong. Half of success in life comes from showing up. So hit send and show up.
