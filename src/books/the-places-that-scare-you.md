What sticks out most to be about this book is how timeless the advice given is.
At first when I discovered it, I thought it had been written recently given the title.
But no, it was written in 2002. Worth noting, that would have been a year following 9/11.
The United States certainly at a point of confusion. Nevertheless, following a pandemic,
this book is perfect.
